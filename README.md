# ESP32-Demos

This is intended to easily demonstrate some common accessories and sensors that can be used with the 
ESP-32 Dev Kit C V2 board, all in one sketch rather than multiple tutorials.  Provided as a PlatformIO
project using the libraries from https://platformio.org/lib.

Wiring diagram and BOM details coming...
